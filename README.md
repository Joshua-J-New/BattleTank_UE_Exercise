# BattleTank_UE_Exercise
An open-world game where users engage in a tank battle - built with the UE 4's, AI, landscape, and control system 

This is the online repository of my project - I am following along with the instruction and exercises in Ben Tristem's "Unreal Engine Developer Course" and this constitutes the third main project for the course.
